# Database Workflow - University Survey System

## üìã Overview

This document explains how database tables are updated throughout the university survey workflow using the **revised schema** with campaign-based cryptographic inheritance and enhanced completion tracking.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CORRECTION**: The `survey_responses` table does **NOT** contain `survey_id`. Only `campaign_id` is stored at the campaign level. The `survey_id` is extracted from the `answer_string` during the decryption process.

## üîÑ Complete Workflow with Table Updates

### Phase 1: University Data Input (Admin Only)

#### 1.1 School Setup
**Tables Updated:**

### Phase 3: Teacher Input Phase (Teachers)

#### 3.1 Teacher Chooses Course and Adds Students
**Tables Updated:**

- `enrollments` - **INSERT** when teacher adds students to course
- `course_assignments` - **UPDATE** students_input_completed = true

**Updated By:** Teacher

### Phase 4: Survey Generation and Token Distribution (Admin)

#### 4.1 Admin Closes Campaign and Launches Surveys
**Tables Updated:**
- `survey_campaigns` - **UPDATE** status to 'open' and set closed_at
- `surveys` - **INSERT** lightweight surveys (inherit crypto from campaign)

**Updated By:** Admin

#### 4.2 Generate and Distribute Tokens (Campaign-level)
**Tables Updated:**
- `survey_tokens` - **INSERT** campaign-level tokens for all enrolled students
- `survey_completions` - **INSERT** completion tracking for each survey

**Updated By:** Admin

### Phase 5: Student Participation (Students)

#### 5.1 Student Uses Token
**Tables Updated:**
- `survey_tokens` - **UPDATE** mark token as used

**Updated By:** Student

#### 5.2 Student Submits Batch Survey Responses
**Tables Updated:**
- `survey_completions` - **UPDATE** mark individual surveys as completed
- `survey_tokens` - **UPDATE** mark token as completed

**Updated By:** Student

**Note:** Student submits encrypted responses directly to blockchain, NOT to server database

### Phase 6: Admin Fetches Responses from Blockchain
**Tables Updated:**
- `survey_responses` - **INSERT** encrypted responses fetched from blockchain (campaign_id only, NO survey_id)
- `surveys` - **UPDATE** total_responses count

**Updated By:** Admin

**Note:** `survey_responses` table only stores `campaign_id`, `encrypted_data`, and `commitment`. No `survey_id` is stored here.

### Phase 7: Survey Closure (Admin)

#### 7.1 Admin Closes Surveys
**Tables Updated:**
- `survey_campaigns` - **UPDATE** status to 'closed'

**Updated By:** Admin

### Phase 8: Response Decryption and Analytics (Admin)

#### 8.1 Admin Initiates Decryption
**Tables Updated:**
- `decrypted_responses` - **INSERT** decrypted responses from blockchain data
- `parsed_responses` - **INSERT** parsed responses from decrypted answer_string
- `survey_analytics` - **INSERT** survey-level analytics
- `teacher_performance` - **INSERT** teacher performance metrics
- `student_completion` - **INSERT** student completion tracking

**Updated By:** Admin

## üîÑ Key Update Patterns

### INSERT Operations
- **Admin**: schools, teacher_logins, teachers, courses, students, semesters, survey_campaigns, surveys, survey_tokens, survey_completions, survey_responses, decrypted_responses, parsed_responses, survey_analytics, teacher_performance, student_completion
- **Teacher**: course_assignments, enrollments

### UPDATE Operations
- **Admin**: survey_campaigns (status changes), surveys (response counts)
- **Teacher**: course_assignments (completion status)
- **Student**: survey_tokens (usage, completion), survey_completions (completion)

### READ Operations (No Updates)
- **Student Dashboard**: Fetch available surveys for token
- **Teacher Interface**: Fetch assigned courses and students
- **Admin Analytics**: Fetch aggregated performance data

## üéØ Critical Update Sequences

### 1. Campaign Lifecycle (Admin)
`survey_campaigns`: draft ‚Üí teachers_input ‚Üí open ‚Üí closed

### 2. Token Lifecycle (Student)
`survey_tokens`: created ‚Üí used ‚Üí completed

### 3. Teacher Input Tracking (Teacher)
`course_assignments`: students_input_completed = false ‚Üí true

### 4. Response Processing (Admin)
`survey_responses` ‚Üí `decrypted_responses` ‚Üí `parsed_responses` ‚Üí analytics tables

## üéØ Student Completion Queries

### 1. Students Not Completed in Campaign (Campaign-level):
```sql
-- Using campaign_completion_status view
SELECT * FROM campaign_completion_status 
WHERE campaign_id = 'campaign-id' 
AND token_completed = false;
```

### 2. Student Participation Rate (Individual survey completion):
```sql
-- Using student_participation_rate view
SELECT * FROM student_participation_rate 
WHERE student_email = 'student@university.edu' 
AND campaign_id = 'campaign-id';
-- Shows: Student A completed 4 out of 8 surveys (50%)
```

### 3. Specific Student Enrollments Not Completed:
```sql
-- Using enrollment_completion_status view
SELECT * FROM enrollment_completion_status 
WHERE student_email = 'student@university.edu' 
AND campaign_id = 'campaign-id' 
AND survey_completed = false;
```

This workflow ensures data consistency and provides comprehensive tracking throughout the entire university survey process.
